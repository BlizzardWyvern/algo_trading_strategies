# DYDX Node Connector

Hey there!
This project is wip.
It provides one connector class, handling the communication with the dydx API and providing some convenience in usage <br>
Not all functionality is included yet! <br>

Later the goal will be, to implement different trading strategies for everyone to use. <br>
One first example can be found in pnl-strategy.ts<br>

# How to start
First of all, clone the repo. <br>
Then you need to provided all required keys of the .env file. (check .env-template for format)<br> 
To retrieve starkkey/api key of dydx, do the following: <br>
* Connect your metamask with dydx (https://trade.stage.dydx.exchange/). Turn on the checkbox "remember me"
* Inspect the webpage with F12
* Go to app>local storage>https://trade.stage.dydx.exchange/
* Find stark key and api keys to copy all into the .env 

In addition, you need an Ethereum node like https://moralis.io/, which needs to be entered into the .env<br>
The last step is to copy the ETH Address of your metamask wallet into the .env<br>

# Run example
```
 node --loader ts-node/esm .\src\pnl-strategy.ts
```

# General
All your orders are logged in project.log.
Jest for testing got added, but the implementation lacks.

# Security
The potential security vulnerabilities in the dependencies are known but remain on dydx side. <br>
Fixing this could lead to new problems in the dydx API.
